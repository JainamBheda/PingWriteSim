# **PingWriteSim**
### Developed by Jainam Bheda

## About Project:

- PingWriteSim is a Java desktop app with three tools in one: a ping tester, a Java code editor with compile and run, and an ARP simulator. It helps users learn basic networking and Java programming through a simple and interactive interface.


## Features
### 🌐 Ping Tester 


- The Ping Tester lets you check the reachability of any host or IP address from your machine.
Just enter a hostname like google.com or an IP address, and it will show the results in real time.

- ✅ Enter any Hostname or IP Address (e.g., google.com, 8.8.8.8)

- 📡 Simulates Ping Request & Response like a terminal

- 🟢 Displays Reachability Status: Tells you if the host is reachable or not

- ⏱️ Shows Response Time in milliseconds for quick analysis

- 📋 Real-Time Output Area for clear visibility of results

- 🧠 Helps Learn how the ping utility works and why it’s used in networking

### 💻 Java Code Editor & Compiler
- The Java Code Editor is a built-in space where users can write, compile, and run Java programs directly within the application—no external IDE required!
- ✍️ Write Java Code inside a built-in text area

- ▶️ Compile & Run code with one click

- 📤 Shows Output & Errors in a dedicated area

- 📚 Supports OOP Concepts like classes, inheritance, interfaces, etc.

- 📦 Use Any Java Package for logic, utilities, or data structures

- 🧮 Try Out Data Structures like Arrays, Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists, HashMaps, Trees, etc.

### 🧠 ARP Protocol Simulator

- The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Simulator visually demonstrates how devices on a network map IP addresses to MAC addresses. This tool helps users understand how ARP requests and replies work in real-world local networks.

- 🛠️ Add Custom IP-MAC Entries to simulate a network environment

- 📋 View Predefined Table of existing IP ↔ MAC mappings

- 🔄 Simulate ARP Request and Reply between a source and a destination

- 🌐 Enter Source & Destination IPs and watch how the ARP resolution happens

- 🔍 Step-by-Step Output explaining the ARP process
